    "\n",
    "In previous weeks, we have focused more on the inferential aspects of the models. This week, we are switching our focus to prediction. As it turns out, in many situations, the inference is not a priority. \n",
    "\n",
    "When diagnosing a disease, a doctor obtains the patient's medical history, some contextual information (e.g., profession, age, has the patient travelled abroad? etc.), combined with some tests results, allows the doctor to make a diagnosis. \n",
    "\n",
    "A priori, the patient doesn't care how exactly the doctor made the diagnosis. For example, did the doctor weigh in more on the patient's age? or maybe on the result of a blood test? or even a complex combination of those two? Whatever! As long as the diagnosis is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to analyze whether the doctor's process (or *model*) to make the diagnosis is reliable, we must consider different aspects. For example,\n",
    "given that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is the doctor able to positively diagnose a high percentage of sick patients? (*sensitivity*)\n",
    "- Is the doctor able to correctly identify a high percentage of the non-sick patients? (*specificity*)\n",
    "- If the doctor says that a patient is sick, is there a high chance that the patient is sick? (*precision*)\n",
    "- Considering all the doctor's positive and negative diagnoses, is the doctor right in most cases? (*accuracy*)\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, looking at all these aspects might look redundant. But let's try to understand why it is not. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the doctors always said a patient was sick, all the sick patients would be diagnosed. Therefore, the doctor would have great *sensitivity*. However, this doesn't seem very helpful, right? This would be reflected by the doctor's precision.\n",
    "- On the other hand, if the doctor only diagnoses patients as sick if there's overwhelming evidence, then the *precision* would be quite high. However, the *sensitivity* would be low, i.e., many sick patients wouldn't be diagnosed.\n",
    "- Imagine a very rare disease. Say 1 case in 100K people. If the doctor always says that the patient is not sick of that disease, then the accuracy will still be pretty high because the part he is getting wrong is quite small. Nonetheless, quite important! \n",

    "\n",
    "In the previous week, we introduced logistic regression as a generative model for binary responses. We have already used this model for inferential purposes. Nonetheless, this model can also be used for predictions, i.e., using an estimated logistic model (via a training set) to classify new observations from a test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "To check prediction accuracy in classification, we cannot use metrics such as the **Root Mean Squared Error (R-MSE)** as in ordinary least squares (OLS) regression (check `worksheet_09` and `tutorial_09`). Therefore, this worksheet will introduce new metrics meant for logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, let us recap the Logistic Regression. The binary logistic regression model has a response variable in the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "0 \\; \\; \\; \\; \\mbox{otherwise.}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As the response variable can only take the values `1` or `0`, the key parameter becomes the probability that $Y_i$ takes on the value of `1`, i.e. the probability of success, denoted as $p_i$. Hence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_i \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p_i).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The binary logistic regression models the probability of success, $p_i$, of the binary response $Y_i$. To re-express $p_i$ on an unrestricted scale, the modelling is done in terms of the logit function (the link function in this GLM). Specifically, $p_i$ ($i = 1, 2, \\dots, n$) will depend on the values of the $p - 1$ inputs $X_{i, 1}, X_{i, 2}, \\dots, X_{i, p-1}$ along with $p$ regression terms (including the intercept $\\beta_0$):\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the $\\log$ notation in the model above refers to the **natural logarithm**, i.e., **logarithm base $e$**. The equation above for $p_i$ shows a binary logistic regression model resulting in values of $p_i$ always between `0` and `1`. The response in this GLM is called the log-odds, the logarithm of the odds $p_i/(1 - p_i)$, the ratio of the probability of the event to the probability of the non-event."
